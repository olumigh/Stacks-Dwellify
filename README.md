## Security Considerations

- Funds for rental and deposit are transferred immediately upon renting.
- Deposits are securely stored in a designated escrow address.
- Validations prevent:
  - Renting unavailable properties.
  - Unauthorized updates or lease termination.
  - Rapid-fire rating manipulation (via cooldowns).
- Only the contract owner can update critical configurations.

---

##  Deployment Instructions

1. Deploy the contract to your Stacks blockchain environment.
2. Immediately call `initialize` to set the platform fee and escrow address.
3. Begin interacting: adding properties, renting, rating, etc.

## Future Improvements (Suggestions)

- **Dispute Resolution**: Enable owner-tenant disputes to be resolved via smart contract arbitration.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Accept stablecoins or other crypto assets for rental payment.
- **Insurance Features**: Offer optional insurance for property rentals.
- **Advanced Escrow Logic**: Allow partial deposit returns for minor damages.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Allow owners to set prices dynamically over time.
